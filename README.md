### Task Completion

Building the Keleya pregnancy app UI was an interesting feat.   

I handled validation with formik and yup.   
Typescript also came in handy for type checking.   
The app supports Internationalization and localization for two languages; English and German.   
I customized the app to enable seamless color theme transitioning with desirable colors.   
I also did snapshot testing and used redux for state management.
